The launcher has a set of error codes that refer to various errors within the code that are caused by accident. These errors are not on the launcher code's end, but could be the fault of a game developer.

Here is a reference sheet containing all error codes and their meaning:

SFT10xx: Error with JSON metadata file in root of game
==========================================================

SFT1001: MainExecutable doesn't point to a valid file
SFT1002: Game doesn't have a Name in the metadata file

SFT1102: Couldn't download game files, HTTP 404 error
